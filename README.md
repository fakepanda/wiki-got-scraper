# wiki-got-scraper
Let's scrape Wikipedia for Game of Thrones characters!

Generates a list of main characters from the *Game of Thrones* series found on a Wikipedia page aptly titled *[List of Game of Thrones characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_Thrones_characters)*.

Run with `npm start` which will spit out a file in the same directly titled `got.js` containing an array of all main characters.
